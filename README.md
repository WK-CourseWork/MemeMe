MemeMe V1.0 This is the 1st version of my MemeMe app! Tou maybe wondering what this app does, well I'm gonna tell you. This app lets you take any photo from your libary and make a meme out of it, the app also lets you take a new photo and make a new meme out of it. You can then share the memes you make, you can post them online, or you can just save them for yourself. The possibile hilarious memes you could make are endless.
